This project is a Temperature Converter application developed in C++.
It allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit using a simple and interactive graphical user interface (GUI) built with the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).
The project demonstrates basic programming concepts such as conditional statements, user input handling, and mathematical calculations, along with GUI development in C++.
